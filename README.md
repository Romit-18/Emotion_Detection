# Emotion Detector from Text and Speech using Flask and Whisper
This project is a Text and Speech-based Emotion Detection system built using Flask, Whisper (OpenAI), and a neural network model (MLPClassifier). It allows users to input either typed text or an audio file and returns the detected emotion. All predictions are made locally without any external API calls.

Features
✅ Emotion detection from typed text or uploaded speech
✅ Whisper ASR for local, offline speech-to-text conversion
✅ Neural network classifier (MLPClassifier from scikit-learn)
✅ Simple web interface built with Flask
✅ Command-line support for quick testing and batch inputs
